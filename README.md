## Bugs, Sourcery and Rodrigo [Alpha v1.0]

# About
WingedHoof is the mod made by me and my girlfriend

With the focus on everything we like and want to add to Minecraft,
 just for fun

I am programming and she is doing all the art related stuff

We are learning how to do a Minecraft Mod making this project

# Running
## Requirements
You need **`Gradlew`** and `Java` version **8** to **11**
>*(I took 1 hour to figure this out)*

```sh
sudo apt install gradle openjdk-11-jdk
```

## Compiling
```sh
./gradlew build
```

Now move the compiled *jar* inside `build/libs` to your *Minecraft mod folder*
 *(Obviously you need Minecraft Forge or some other Minecraft Mod Loader)*


# IDEAS
The development just started and we are still learning the basics

#### May have changes

## Items
- Net

- Medallions
	+ Used on the helmet slot
	+ Crafted with: *chains*, *gold*, *amber* and *some mob item* *(not all)*
	+ Have a **effect** related to the mob item used
	+ **Bat Teeth Medallion:** Chance to gain health after hitting an enemy
		* *10%* of chance to steal *2 hearts*
	+ **Cow Horny Meddallion:** The lower the health, the greater the damage
		* *20+ Hearts* = Normal Damage
		* *1 Heart* = +15 Damage
	* **FireFly Medallion:** Produces source of light
	* **Fly Medallion:** Increase player's speed

## Mobs
- Ahiro
	+ Like a baby zombie, but way stronger and small
	+ Everytime you re-spawn you get a *Bat Kill Limit* with a random limit *(you can't see)*
		* If the number of bats you killed reaches the *Bat Kill Limit*, Ahiro appears
	+ Drops a **Axe** that deals **9 damage** *(Cutinho)*

- Bat rework
	+ Drops *Bat Teeth*

- Bettle
	+ Can **collect** with net
	+ *1%* of chance to drop **Bettle Bark**
	+ They can **fight** with each other if you collect and put them together
	+ When they die in a fight, it **drops like a item** *(like that clay creatures mod)*

- Cow rework
	+ Chance to drop *Cow Horn*

- FireFly
	+ Like a *Fly* but it glows

- Fly
	+ You can catch it
	+ ...
	+ It flies and... Bzz Bzz Bzz Bzzzz
	+ Chance to drop **Fly Wing Fragment**
		* With 9 **Fly Wing Fragment** you can craft a **Fly Wing**

- Rodrigo
	+ Rodrigo PET
	+ Does **Bzz Bzz Bzzz**
	+ Useless
	+ Annoying



## Ores
- Amber
	+ Used to make **Amber Armor** *(a bit better than Iron Armor)*
	+ Same rarity than Lapiz Lazuli
	+ *Bettle Bark* can be used with a **Amber Armor** to craft **Bettle Armor**

- Tim
	+ Very weak material
	+ Used as fuel for **Soldering Machine**

- Paladium
	+ Stronger than iron
	+ Used with *Amber* and *Tin* on *Sldering Machine* to make a **Strong Sword** or **Strong Axe**
